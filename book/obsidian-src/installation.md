## Installation

> **Note**: 
> _Obsidian-export_ has been developed on Linux.
> Windows and Mac OS are covered as part of the continuous integration tests run on GitHub, but these have not been tested by the author.
> Experience reports from users on these operating systems would be welcomed.

Binary releases for x86-64 processors are provided for Windows, Linux and Mac operating systems on a best-effort basis.
These may be downloaded from: <https://github.com/zoni/obsidian-export/releases>

Alternatively, _obsidian-export_ may be compiled from source using [Cargo], the official package manager for Rust, by using the following steps:

1. Install the Rust toolchain: <https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install>
2. Run: `cargo install https://github.com/zoni/obsidian-export.git --locked`

The same `cargo install` command can later be used to upgrade to a newer release as well.
